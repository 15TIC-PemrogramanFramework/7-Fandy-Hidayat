					<h2 style="color: #10c7bf; margin-left:40px;">1. INSPECTION SERVICES</h2>
					<br>
					<h4 style="margin-left:100px">QES offers the services listed below, coupled with the value-added service of secured online scheduling and reporting. Providing inspection, testing, certification & verification services to ensure that products, services & systems meet quality, safety & performance requirements.
						<br><br>
						<u>First-Article Inspections</u>
						<br>
						QES inspects first-article samples prior to volume production. This verifies that product specifications are being met and avoids unnecessary re-engineering work later.
						<br><br>
						<u>In-Process Inspections</u>
						<br>
						These on-site inspections evaluate samples of your products selected during the manufacturing process. This confirms the quality of your product and allows any necessary changes to be addressed early on, reducing rework time and costs.
						<br><br>
						<u>Pre-Shipment Inspections</u>
						<br>
						During a pre-shipment inspection, our engineers/inspectors verify that finished goods conform to customerâ€™s specifications.
						<br><br>
						<u>Sample Collection Service</u>
						<br>
						Inspections are not always the service that you need. If you need to ensure that samples for your evaluation, lab testing or customer approval submission have been randomly selected, QES QC can help. With Pro QC's Sample Collection Service, we visit the factory, select random samples on your behalf and then we send them to you, your test lab or to any other destination that you designate. Since no inspection is required, we can offer rapid service at a very affordable rate production order control services contribute to improved timeliness and consistency.
						<br><br>
						<u>Production Order Monitoring and Expediting</u>
						<br>
						QES measures and reports on progress to meet shipping schedule commitments. Working closely with you and your suppliers, we support timely deliveries and keep you informed of any unexpected delays or concerns.
						<br><br>
						<u>Container Loading Supervision</u>
						<br>
						QES ensures that proper methods are employed during product loading, and we verify counts on-site.
						<br><br>
						<u>Cargo Loading Supervision</u>
						<br>
						QES ensures that proper methods are employed during product loading, and we verify counts on-site.
